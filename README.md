# 💳 Digital Bank - Zustand

![Digital Bank](./logo_bai.png)

A small banking system developed with **React** and **Zustand** to practice global state management in a simple, fast, and efficient way.

The project simulates a digital wallet where users can view their balance, make deposits, withdraw money, update personal information, and track transaction history.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

This project was developed with the goal of studying and applying **Zustand** as a state management solution in React.

The application was created to understand in practice:

- Creating stores with Zustand;
- Managing global states;
- Creating actions inside the store;
- Updating data across different components;
- Data persistence;
- Organization of React components.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

## ⚛️ React

A library used to build the user interface.

React was chosen because of its ease of creating reusable components and its wide adoption in modern Front-End development.

---

## 🐻 Zustand

A library used for global state management.

Zustand was chosen because it is a simpler and lighter alternative to Redux, allowing application state control without the need for complex configurations.

Used to manage:

- User name;
- Account balance;
- Transaction history;
- Deposit and withdrawal actions.

---

## ⚡ Vite

A tool used for project creation and build process.

Vite was chosen because it provides:

- Fast development environment startup;
- Faster development experience;
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR);
- Optimized production builds.

---

## 🎨 CSS

Used for interface styling.

A responsive design was created with:

- Cards;
- Custom buttons;
- Organized layout;
- Interface similar to a real banking application.

---

## 💾 LocalStorage

Used to store user data in the browser.

It allows the application to keep:

- Name;
- Balance;
- Transaction history;

even after closing or refreshing the page.
